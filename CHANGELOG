V0.6.2 (26, Feb 2010)
  - Added some missing GML functions
  - Changed CGMVariable boolean constructor so it now sets value of the variable using bool
  - CGMVariable::c_str now returns empty string instead of NULL when the string is empty

V0.6.1 (14, Feb 2010)
  - Added compatibility with the MinGW compiler
  - Fixed bug in IFonts interface

V0.6 (30, Jan 2010)
  - The library is now GM8 compatible
  - Added GM8 functions and constants
  - Added new interfaces that accesses: fonts, built-in variables, particle systems, particle types, emitters, deflectors, destroyers, changers and attractors
  - Improved the method of GM function replacing and added possibility to register your own GM functions
  - Added new functions to the CGMVariable class that converts between string and real values
  - Added following methods to CGMAPI class: PatchIdentifierTypeCheckOrder, ParticleData, GetOtherInstancePtr, GetOtherInstanceID, SetOtherInstance
  - Changed SetGMFunctionAddress method into GMFunctionRegister in CGMAPI class
  - GM functions that have changed in GM8 (e.g. sprite_add) are overloaded with the new set of parameters.
  - Fixed some bugs in GM functions, comments and CGMVariable class
  - GMINSTANCE structure uses now properties to access its members.
  - Renamed following methods in the CGMAPI class: GetD3DTexture (GetDirect3DTexture), D3DData (Direct3DData), EnumInstances (EnumerateInstances)
  - Renamed some of the functions defined in GmapiCore
  - Renamed some of the variables and structure members
  - Removed ReleaseBitmap methods from interfaces
  - Renamed most of the functions declared in GmapiCore.h
  - Some other bug fixes and changes

V0.5 (26, Nov 2009)
  - Some bugs has been fixed
  - Several small fixes in comments
  - New methods in CGMAPI class: SetGMFunctionAddress, SetGMFunctionResult, PreserveFunctionData and RestoreFunctionData, which are helpful in manipulating GM's function table (replacing GM functions with user-defined)

V0.4 (17, May 2009)
  - From now to use D3D8 with GMAPI You have to define GMAPI_USE_D3D, "GMAPI_NO_D3D" has been removed
  - GMVARIABLE structure: renamed to GMVALUE, added << operator overload with std::ostream, member names changed
  - New GMVARIABLE structure (it turned out that the previous GMVARIABLE structure represents, in fact, GM's value format - that's why i've renamed above-mentioned structure)
  - CGMVariable: New ctor that takes GMVALUE ref in parameter
  - New methods in CGMAPI class: GetSymbolID, GetLocalVariablePtr, GetGlobalVariablePtr, GetInstancePtr, GetCurrentInstancePtr, GetCurrentInstanceID, SetCurrentInstance, EnumInstances & With. (+ other, unimportant :))
  - Small fixes in GMAPICore\main.asm (+ new GMFindSymbolID function)
  - MessageBox calls changed to MessageBoxA (projects with UNICODE character set could'nt be compiled)
  - Prefixes of pointer type definitions in GmapiDefs has been changed from "LP" to "P" (e.g. LPGMSPRITE >>> PGMSPRITE)
  - Several small fixes in comments

V0.3 (5, Apr 2009)
  - Added ReleaseBitmap method to ISpriteSubimage & IBackground classes, which deallocates image's bitmap from memory

V0.2 (4, Apr 2009)
  - Added ISounds (CGMAPI::Sounds) & ISound interfaces, which gives access to the sound resources
  - Several small fixes in resource accessors interfaces (IBackgrounds, IScripts...)
